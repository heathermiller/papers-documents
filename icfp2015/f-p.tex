\section{Introduction}


Functional programming concepts are making inroads in hot up-and-coming
frameworks for distributed computing and, dare we say it, ``big data.''
Arguably, MapReduce was one of the first systems to pick up FP concepts,
albeit outside the context of functional languages. More recent frameworks are
now also leveraging classical functional language features, such as higher-
order functions (e.g., Spark). This is a boon for mathematically-oriented data
analytics and higher-order functions provide flexible abstraction mechanisms.
However, to provide fault tolerance in the context of large-scale distributed
computing, such frameworks for distribution are built atop of tall stacks of
code which is typically imperative and untyped, losing most of the benefits
enjoyed by the users of their high-level APIs. [What's more,] the benefits of
FP, abstraction, composition, equational reasoning, are seemingly lost by
engineers building these distributed systems.

Fortunately, FP techniques are not only useful for designing good user-facing
APIs. This paper presents a deep connection between the pillars of FP and one
of the most important challenges of distributed computing: fault tolerance. To
this end we present a new programming model for typed distributed functional
programming. This model aims to:

\begin{itemize}
\item distill existing fault recovery mechanisms based on lineage to their essence.
Importantly, this paper shows that there is a direct correspondence between
the concept of lineage, as it is widely used in distributed systems, and well-known
pillars of FP. Our distributed programming model is a consequent
implementation of this correspondence, and demonstrates it in executable form
in the context of an implementation in and for Scala.

\item improve type-safety at the boundary of serialized and deserialized data.
Importantly, the design and implementation of our programming model shows that
even the layer in a distributed system that processes freshly deserialized
data (typically, this layer sits right on top of the network communication
layer) can not only be written in a strongly-typed way, but it can even
leverage performance improvements due to type-specialized serialization.
\end{itemize}

Our programming model is centered around a new distributed persistent data
structure, the silo. A silo is a typed container for a single (immutable)
value. A silo is ``stationary''; it is never moved away from the host on which
it was created. Computations on silos are expressed using SiloRefs, proxy
objects representing remote silos. The primary means to operate on a silo is
by passing a serializable closure to it using a SiloRef. SiloRefs provide both
a standard monadic interface and data-flow combinators based on single
assignment.

To ensure safe and efficient distribution of closures, our model leverages
both syntactic and type-based restrictions. For instance, closures sent to
remote silos are required to conform to the restrictions imposed by the so-called
``spore'' abstraction~\cite{Spores}. Among others, the syntax and
static semantics of spores guarantees the absence of runtime serialization
errors due to closure environments that are not serializable.

The specific technical contributions of this paper are:

\begin{itemize}
\item A new programming model for functional processing of distributed data. By
leveraging safe serializable closures, it prevents common usage errors of
other widely-used data analytics stacks.

\item A new model of lineage-based fault recovery based on typed FP. Our approach
extends the capabilities of existing implementations by supporting type-specialized,
statically-generated serializers even in the context of
existentially-quantified types.

\item A complete, distributed implementation of the model in Scala.

\item A validation of spores in the context of distributed programming.

\item Self-describing pickles?

\item An experimental evaluation.
\end{itemize}

Closely related work here.

Structure. Our approach is to describe our model from a high level,
elaborating upon key concepts. While focusing on .. over time. We then proceed
to zoom in and make precise each component of our model in Sections~\ref{}.

\section{Overview of Model}

The best way to quickly visualize the F-P model is to think in terms of a
persistent functional data structure with structural sharing. Then, rather
than containing pure data, imagine instead that the structure represents a
directed acyclic graph (DAG) of transformations on distributed data.

Importantly, since this DAG of computations is a persistent data structure
itself, it is safe to exchange (copies of) subgraphs of a DAG between remote
nodes. This enables a robust and easy-to-reason-about model of fault
tolerance. We call subgraphs of a DAG lineages; lineages enable restoring the
data of failed nodes through re-applying the transformations represented by
their DAG. This sequence of applications must begin with data available from
stable storage.

Central to our model is the careful use of laziness. Computations on
distributed data are never executed eagerly; instead, applying a function to
distributed data just creates an immutable lineage. To obtain the result of a
computation, it is necessary to force its lineage. Within our programming
model, this force operation makes network communication (and thus
possibilities for latency) explicit, which is considered to be a strength when
designing distributed systems~\cite{ANoteDistComp}. Deferred evaluation also
enables optimizing distributed computations through operation fusion, which
avoids the creation of unnecessary intermediate data structures. This kind of
optimization is particularly important and effective in distributed
systems~\cite{FlumeJava}.

For these reasons, we believe that laziness should be viewed as an enabler in
the design of distributed systems.

\noindent The F-P model consists of three main components:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf Silos:} stationary typed data containers.
  \item {\bf SiloRefs:} references to local or remote Silos.
  \item {\bf Spores:} safe, serializable functions.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{1mm}

\paragraph{Silos}
A silo is a typed data container. It is stationary in the sense that it does
not move between machines -- it remains on the machine where it was created.
Data stored in a silo is typically loaded from stable storage, such as a
distributed file system. A program operating on data stored in a silo can only
do so using a reference to the silo, a \verb|SiloRef|.

\paragraph{SiloRefs}
Similar to a proxy object, a SiloRef represents, and allows interacting with,
both local and remote silos. SiloRefs are immutable, storing identifiers to
locate possibly remote silos. SiloRefs are also typed (\verb|SiloRef[T]|)
corresponding to the type of their silo's data, leading to well-typed network
communication. The SiloRef provides three primitive operations/combinators
(some are lazy, some are not): map, flatMap, and send. map lazily applies a
user-defined function to data pointed to by the SiloRef, creating in a new
silo containing the result of this application. Like map, flatMap lazily
applies a user-defined function to data pointed to by the SiloRef. Unlike map,
the user-defined function passed to flatMap returns a SiloRef whose contents
is transferred to the new silo returned by flatMap. Essentially, flatMap
enables accessing the contents of (local or remote) silos from within remote
computations. We illustrate these primitives in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:primitives}.

\paragraph{Spores}
Spores are safe closures that are guaranteed to be serializable and thus
distributable (presented in previous work~\cite{Spores}). They  are a closure-
like abstraction and type system which gives authors of distributed frameworks
a principled way of controlling the environment, such as by controlling the
types that closures can capture.

\subsection{Basic Usage}

The only way to interact with silos is through the use of SiloRefs. A SiloRef
can be thought of as an immutable handle to the remote data contained within a
corresponding silo. Users interact with this distributed data by applying
functions to SiloRefs, which are later applied to the data within the
corresponding silo. As is the case for persistent data structures, when a
function is applied to a piece of distributed data via a SiloRef, a new
SiloRef representing the transformed data is returned.

The simplest illustration of the model is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:basic-diagram}
(time flows vertically from top to bottom). Here, we start with a
\verb|SiloRef[T]| which points to a piece of remote data contained within a
\verb|Silo[T]|. When the function shown as $\lambda$ of type $T \Rightarrow S$
is applied to \verb|SiloRef[T]| and ``forced'' (sent over the wire), a new
SiloRef of type \verb|SiloRef[S]| is immediately returned. Note that
\verb|SiloRef[S]| contains a reference to its parent SiloRef,
\verb|SiloRef[T]| (This is how {\em lineages} are constructed). Meanwhile, the
function asynchronously travels over the network and is applied to
\verb|Silo[T]|, eventually producing a new \verb|Silo[S]| containing the data
transformed by function $\lambda$. This new SiloRef \verb|SiloRef[S]| can be
used even before its corresponding silo is materialized (\ie before the data
in \verb|Silo[S]| is computed) – the F-P framework queues up operations
applied to \verb|SiloRef[S]| and applies them when \verb|Silo[S]| is fully
materialized.

Complicated DAGs can be created this way.

\paragraph{Creating Silos}
Besides a type definition for SiloRef, our framework also provides a companion
singleton object (Scala's form of modules). The singleton object provides
factory methods for obtaining SiloRefs referring to silos populated with some
initial data:\footnote{The given code snippets are minimally simplified for
clarity. No essential details are omitted.}

\begin{lstlisting}
object SiloRef {
  def fromTextFile(host: Host)(file: File): SiloRef[List[String]] = ...
  def fromFun[T](host: Host)(s: Spore[Unit, T]): SiloRef[T] = ...
}
\end{lstlisting}

Each of the factory methods has a \verb|host| parameter that specifies the
target host (address/port) on which to create the silo. Note that the
\verb|fromFun| method takes a spore closure as an argument to make sure it can
be serialized and sent to \verb|host|. In each case, the returned SiloRef
contains its \verb|host| as well as an identifier that uniquely identifies its
silo on the \verb|host|. To obtain this host-unique identifier, each factory
method has to communicate with the target \verb|host|.

The type \verb|SiloRef[T]| has the following main operations:

\begin{lstlisting}
trait SiloRef[T] {
  def map[S](s: Spore[T, S]): SiloRef[S]
  def flatMap[S](s: Spore[T, SiloRef[S]]): SiloRef[S]
  def send(): Future[T]
}
\end{lstlisting}

The \verb|map| method takes a spore that is to be applied to the data in the
silo of the receiver SiloRef. Rather than immediately sending the spore across
the network, and waiting for the operation to finish, the \verb|map| method is
\emph{lazy}. Without involving any network communication, it immediately
returns a SiloRef referring to a new, lazily-created silo. This new SiloRef
only contains lineage information, namely, a reference to the original
SiloRef, a reference to the argument spore, and the information that it is the
result of a \verb|map| invocation. (The \verb|send| method is used to force
the materialization of the result silo, see below.) For example, given a silo
with a list of \verb|Person| records, the following application of \verb|map|
defines a silo containing only the records of adults:

\begin{lstlisting}
val persons: SiloRef[List[Person]] = ...
val adults = persons.map(spore { ps => ps.filter(p => p.age >= 18) })
\end{lstlisting}

Like \verb|map|, the \verb|flatMap| method takes a spore that is to be applied
to the data in the silo of the receiver SiloRef. However, the crucial
difference is in the type of the spore argument whose result type is a SiloRef
in this case. Semantically, the new silo created by \verb|flatMap| is defined
to contain the data of the silo that the user-defined spore returns. The
\verb|flatMap| combinator adds expressiveness to our model that is essential
to express more interesting computation DAGs. For example, consider the
problem of combining the information contained in two different silos
(potentially located on different hosts). Suppose the information of a silo
containing \verb|Vehicle| records should be enriched with other details only
found in the \verb|adults| silo. In the following, \verb|flatMap| is used to
create a silo of \verb|(Person, Vehicle)| pairs where the names of person and
vehicle owner match:

\begin{lstlisting}
val vehicles: SiloRef[Vehicle] = ...
// adults that own a vehicle
val owners = adults.flatMap(spore {
  val localVehicles = vehicles // spore header
  ps =>
    localVehicles.map(spore {
      val localps = ps // spore header
      vs =>
      localps.flatMap(p =>
        // list of (p, v) for a single person p
        vs.flatMap { v =>
          if (v.owner.name == p.name) List((p, v))
          else List()
        }
      )
    })
})
\end{lstlisting}

Note that the spore passed to \verb|flatMap| declares the capturing of the
\verb|vehicles| SiloRef in its so-called ``spore header''. The spore header
spans all variable definitions between the spore marker and the parameter list
of the spore's closure. The spore header defines the variables that the
spore's closure is allowed to access. Essentially, spores limit the free
variables of their closure's body to the closure's parameters and the
variables declared in the spore's header. Within the spore's closure, it is
necessary to read the data of the \verb|vehicles| silo in addition to the
\verb|persons| list. This requires calling \verb|map| on \verb|localVehicles|.
However, \verb|map| returns a SiloRef; thus, invoking \verb|map| on
\verb|adults| instead of \verb|flatMap| would be impossible, since there would
be no way to get the data out of the silo returned by
\verb|localVehicles.map(..)|. With the use of \verb|flatMap|, however, the
call to \verb|localVehicles.map(..)| creates the final result silo, whose data
is then also contained in the silo returned by \verb|flatMap|.

Clearly, \verb|map| can be expressed in terms of \verb|flatMap|:

\begin{lstlisting}
def map[S](s: Spore[T, S]): SiloRef[S] = {
  this.flatMap(spore {
    val localSpore = s
    x =>
      val res = localSpore(x)
      SiloRef.fromFun(currentHost)(spore {
        val localRes = res
        () => localRes
      })
}
\end{lstlisting}

This should come as no surprise, given that \verb|flatMap| is the monadic bind
operation on SiloRefs, and \verb|SiloRef.fromFun| is the monadic return
operation. The reason why \verb|map| is provided as one of the main operations
of SiloRefs is that direct uses of \verb|map| enable an important optimization
based on operation fusion. This optimization is explained following the
discussion of the third main operation of SiloRefs, \verb|send|.

The final operation of SiloRefs is \verb|send|. It forces the lazy computation
defined by the given SiloRef. Forcing is explicit in our model, because it
requires sending the lineage to the remote node on which the result silo
should be created. Given that network communication has a latency several
orders of magnitude greater than accessing a word in main memory, say, we felt
an explicit send operation a judicious choice. To enable materialization of
remote silos to proceed concurrently, the \verb|send| operation immediately
returns a future. This future is then asynchronously completed with the data
of the given silo. Since calling \verb|send| will materialize a silo and send
its data to the current node, \verb|send| should only be called on silos with
reasonably small data. For example, Figure ?? shows the effect of invoking
\verb|send| on the \verb|labels| SiloRef from above.

The \verb|send| operation can also be used to simply cache a silo in main
memory, for example, because the silo is known to be accessed subsequently:

\begin{lstlisting}
def cache(): Future[Boolean] = this.flatMap(spore {
  val localDoneSiloRef = DoneSiloRef
  res => localDoneSiloRef.send()
}
\end{lstlisting}

The \verb|cache| method can be provided for convenience. It invokes
\verb|send| not directly on the given SiloRef (which would transfer all data
of the silo to the current node); instead, it first uses \verb|flatMap| to
create a new silo that will be completed with the trivial value (e.g., a
Boolean constant) of the \verb|DoneSiloRef| singleton object. Essentially,
invoking \verb|send| on this trivial SiloRef causes the resulting future to be
completed as soon as \verb|this| SiloRef has been materialized in main memory.

Nothing beats a video when something evolves in space in time, so we've also produced a short video to illustrate the model\footnote{\url{https://vimeo.com/120415626}}

\section{Old}

\subsection{Old Intro}

% From the ivory tower, it may not be evident,
% It might not seem this way from the ivory tower,
% but

While it might not seem that way at a glance, mainstream software development
has become largely distributed. Two {\em styles} of distribution
dominate the current landscape; (1) systems composed of microservices,
 % or designed to be software as a service (SaaS),
and (2) systems for ``big data'' processing. Names like Netflix, SoundCloud,
and Twitter have established their competitive offerings by way of one or
both of these types of systems.

Microservices are small, independent (separately-compiled) services running on
different machines which communicate with each other to together make up a
single and complex application. ``Big data''-style applications on the other
hand are typically single applications whose data cannot fit into the memory
of one machine alone. Such applications are typically singly-compiled, with
their binaries distributed across a cluster of machines.

Yet, software developers still fumble with low-level RPC frameworks.
% and sluggish serialization frameworks.
Mainstream programming languages have traditionally offered little support in
this space.

We design module systems, etc, for maximum reuse and productivity, we go as
far as we can to demonstrate their power. But we often . Some of these
concerns have been affectionately referred to as the ``awkward
squad''~\cite{AwkwardSquad} by PL research, and they are concerns that are central to
contemporary software development.

Functional programming brings value to distributed systems builders. The
success of popular Spark can be attributed to functional ideas.

However, beyond Spark's interface, .

We refer to the model as {\em function-passing}, and .


We design a programming model in such a way that we can ``maximize'' static
types, and with it enable type-specialized picklers (statically generated),
typed closures, and type-specialized data structures.

The motto is ``making type inference work for you when optimizing distributed
systems'', or ``how type inference and existential types benefit distributed
systems''.

In existing systems, types are only in the user-facing API and help the user.
However, all too often, the internals of a distributed system are largely
untyped, in particular when operating on data types that are also shipped
remotely. In our approach we now go ahead and make types work so that they
benefit both users (helping catch common errors) \emph{and} distributed
systems builders. Our approach leverages types to provide (1) type-specialized
picklers, and (2) type-specialized collections/builders.

The approach is novel, because noone talks about making sure the unpicklers
and builders themselves are serializable, but that's actually fundamental to
the whole design.

\begin{itemize}

\item We have to make the point that serialization is like a primitive in
systems design, not some extra thing you figure out how to do later, like in
typical PLs. so maybe one central point that we should try to make is that
for distributed systems, serializability is like a key primitive, along with
latency and other things.

\item we want to prove that typed distributed systems are a good idea. right
now a lot of systems for dist computing are fundamentally untyped or
dynamically checked. those that are typed lose type information between
machines.

\item so we're trying to argue that types are good for system builders.

\end{itemize}

The fact that actually these benefits from types \emph{carry over to other
models as well} (not just spark-like models).


Generalization of MapReduce model. Low-level. Inversion of the actor model.
Can represent different many models for distributed computing, e.g. Spark,
Percolator (we probably can't validate this claim.)

\subsection{Evaluation}

we could make the performance eval strong by saying, ok, we implemented real
apps, so we have the real communication that needs to happen (and happens).
and we now make this communication typed, plus we measure exactly the
percentage of time that's spent in serialization for example. and then we
could even interpolate the results, so we could say, ok, if some other dist
system has a lower percentage spent in serialization, then the speed up would
be like this.

and then we could even measure that for real spark, and then interpolate and
say, ok, in the ideal case, meaning using all of our design principles, we
could speed up things like this, if one would re-architect spark to preserve
types (it's a huge task, so out of scope).

well, it would definitely be something that we can measure objectively. the
only thing we have to guard against would be to say, adding picklers and
builders does not otherwise \emph{degrade} performance, like, we'd have to
prove that there's no cost, but \emph{just} the performance benefits. adding
the classname of the unpickler adds a few bytes to each pickle, for example.

we could even show that with babyspark, like have a version that uses java
serialization, then a version that uses pickling without selfdescribing, then
with runtime unpickling, and with all static. because we have those numbers
for babyspark then the interpolation will be much more precise.



\section{Future Work}

Adapt this model for streaming computation. This would take coming up with a
solution to null out references in the {\em lineage}. This would make it possible to instantiate and populate new silos to handle incoming data.
