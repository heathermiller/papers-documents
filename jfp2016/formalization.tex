\section{Formalization}\label{sec:formalization}

We formalize our programming model in the context of a standard, typed lambda
calculus with records. Figure~\ref{fig:syntax} shows the syntax of our core
language. Terms are standard except for the \texttt{spore}, \texttt{map},
\texttt{flatMap}, \texttt{send}, and \texttt{await} terms. A \texttt{spore}
term creates a new spore. It contains a list of variable definitions (the spore
header) and the spore's closure. A term $\texttt{await}(\iota)$ blocks
execution until the future $\iota$ has been completed asynchronously. The
\texttt{map}, \texttt{flatMap}, and \texttt{send} primitives have been
discussed earlier.
