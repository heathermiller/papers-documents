\section{Introduction}

As a field, we work together to develop new languages, foundations, and
systems with the greater goal of improving the state of programming languages.
But little work is ever done to  in the way of ``market research'' to
understand what of these languages/language features/patterns/systems succeeds
or fails in practice, and why. As a collective, we chug along often convincing
only ourselves that some new idea or system will solve some real-life,
widespread problem faced by programmers in their daily software development
practices, without taking the time to look outward and understand how software
developers approach, understand, or even use features/systems/foundations we
develop, fine-tune, or prove correct.
