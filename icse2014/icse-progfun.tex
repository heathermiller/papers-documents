% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.0 May 2012

%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

\title{Case Study: Teaching Functional Programming en masse (need title)}
%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{8} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.
%
\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

\section{Introduction}
Intro

Fox and Patterson~\cite{FoxP12}

One interesting aspect of our course is that it did not require a change in
the way typical on-site university courses are organized.

\subsection{The data}

[Post-course survey results from 6,000-8,000 participants for both iterations]

[Post-course survey results from EPFL students]

[Scores/performance of EPFL students relative to entire course]

\subsection{Contributions}

\begin{itemize}

\item We present an evaluation of a large-scale survey among participants of a
  MOOC on functional programming. Of the more than 100'000 registered
  participants, we evaluate   survey responses from about 15'000 students on a
  variety of questions such as perceived   difficulty or educational background.

\item A detailed report on the format and organization of a MOOC on functional
  programming with more than 100'000 participants.

\item The design and implementation of an infrastructure used to automatically
  grade programming assignments in the cloud.

\end{itemize}

\section{Course Format}

\subsection{Commercial Offering}

The course format lends itself to additional, commercial offerings. For the
third iteration of our course on functional programming principles, Typesafe
has introduced supervised tutorial sessions accompanying select Coursera
classes. In weekly, one-hour tutorial sessions experts from Typesafe provide
in-depth answers to questions about the course material, and discuss solutions
to homework assignments past the deadline. Tutorial groups are small (10
participants max) in order to meet individual mentoring needs as much as
possible. Tutorial session slots are offered in both European and American
time zones.

\section{Survey Results}

\section{Related Work}

Vihavainen et al. report on a MOOC ("Helsinki MOOC") on introductory computer
science with an emphasis on programming~\cite{VihavainenLK12}. Compared to the
Helsinki MOOC, our course had a number of registered students two orders of
magnitude larger. Moreover, the Helsinki MOOC targets introductory
programming, whereas our course targets advanced programming principles. As a
result, our course was very popular especially among advanced developers who
already have a Bachelor's or Master's degree. The Helsinki MOOC does not treat
university students and MOOC participants equal with respect to the material
used for exercises: the students in their university course are beta testers
of the exercise material; thus, only after this beta test and necessary
adjustments is the material released to non-local MOOC participants. Other
organizational differences exist. For example, they give formal credits for
``apprentices'' who are unpaid ``advisors'' among fellow students with limited
responsibilities. Their Extreme Apprenticeship (XA) learning methodology
required a staff of around 20 persons associated with the course, with
different roles and responsibilities. It is unclear whether the XA methodology
would scale to a course of the scale of progfun (50'000 registered students
versus 500 registered students).
